# Jornada Ecological Statistics Tutorials (JEST)

Welcome to the Jornada Ecological Statistics Tutorials, or JEST! Our aim is to
teach introductory and intermediate statistics to Jornada researchers using accessible methods and relatable data.

## Setting up your environment

These tutorials have been developed for learners using `R`. To set up your environment to work through lessons your own, or in a workshop, follow the [setup instructions](./html/setup.html). Lessons rely on either simulated data or Jornada data hosted at EDI. The [teaching datasets page](./html/teaching-datasets.html) will introduce these datasets and how to load them. Additional required `R` packages and suggestions for loading the data are given at the start of each lesson.
