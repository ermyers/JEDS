# JEST

This is the repository for Jornada Ecological Statistics Tutorials, or JEST. The repository collects instructional materials for teaching introductory to intermediate statistics to environmental science researchers associated with the Jornada Basin LTER and Jornada Experimental Range programs. Many of the tutorials here are modeled to some degree on lessons from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) (particularly Data Carpentry) and we often use the Carpentries instructional model during workshops.

More information to come.

## Rendering the tutorials

To render the R markdown tutorials to html, us the `render.R` script. From the R commandline:

    source('render.R')

This will render each tutorial and move to the `html/` directory. New tutorials should be added to the `index.md` file in the appropriate place.
