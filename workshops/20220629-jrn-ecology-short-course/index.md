# JEST @ 2022 Jornada Ecology Short Course

Welcome to our ecological statistics and models workshop for the 2022 Jornada Desert Ecology Short Course. This workshop is the first of what we hope will be a series of "JEST" (tentative title) workshops, with the aim of teach some introductory and intermediate data analysis and statistics skills to Jornada researchers using hands-on programming in R. This is the first-ever JEST workshop, so please be patient with us.

This workshop will teach basic hypothesis testing with ecological data, building from relatively simple t-tests, up to the potentially much more complex use of mixed models. Mixed models are an active area of development in the statistics community, and there are numerous pitfalls and briar patches in the mixed-model landscape. Our goal is to take you up the grassy hill of general linear models, show you the mixed model landscape, an then give you a firm shove so you can begin exploring that on your own.

## Getting set up

The lessons we are teaching have been developed for learners using `R`, and we are expecting people to code along with us as we subset our data, fit models, and interpret results. Please follow the general [setup instructions](../../html/setup.html) to be prepared with a working version of R and R Studio. We will download data directly from the EDI repository at the start of the workshop (see more info on the [teaching datasets page](../../html/teaching-datasets.html')). 

In addition to the basic setup, you should

1. Install these R packages: `tidyverse`, `car`, `emmeans`, and `lme4`.
2. Download the [code handout](./jesc-code-handout.R)

## Lesson plan

We only have one big lesson this time:

1. [Hypothesis testing with general linear models and mixed models](../../html/hypothesis-testing-basics.html)
